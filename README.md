# ðŸš— CarRental Management System (Java)

A powerful Java application for managing car rental contracts, vehicle inventories, and client data. It showcases advanced Java SE concepts including:

- Object-Oriented Programming (inheritance, interfaces, composition, polymorphism)  
- Serialization & Deserialization of contract objects  
- Java Collections Framework for managing lists of vehicles and clients  
- Multi-threaded TCP server with ExecutorService handling multiple clients  
- JDBC integration with SQLite for persistent contract storage  
- JSON-based external communication  
- Functional programming (Java Streams + lambdas) for offer filtering  
- Exception handling, I/O Streams for report generation, and more
